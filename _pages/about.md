I am currently a Ph.D. candidate in the Robotics, Perception & AI Lab in the Department of Electronic Engineering at The Chinese University of Hong Kong(CUHK), Hong Kong SAR, CHina, supervised by Prof. [Max Q.-H. Meng](http://www.ee.cuhk.edu.hk/~qhmeng/). Before that, I received my B.Eng. degree in Automation from Harbin Institute of Techonology(HIT), Harbin, China, in 2020.
